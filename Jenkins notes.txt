What is Jenkins?
-----------------
Jenkins is a continous integration and build server.

It is used to manually,periodically or automatically build software development projects

It is an open source continous integration tool written in java

Before it was named as HUDSON, they renamed in 2011 to Jenkins

What is continous integration?
------------------------------
Developers commit code to shared repository on regular basis. It involves a tool that keeps monitor your
version control system.

Whenever change is detected in version control system, build will be triggered automatically

If the build is not green, system will notify the developers


Why we need continous integration?
-----------------------------------
Since the entire code base is integrated, built and tested constantly, potential bugs and errors are caught 
earlier in the life cycle which results in better quality software

What is continous delivery?
---------------------------
Continous delivery of code to an environment once the code is ready to ship. This could be staging or production.
Here product is delivered to a user base, which can be QA or customers for reveiw and inspection.

What is Continous deployment?
------------------------------
The deployment or release of code to production as soon as it is ready.
It requires continous integration and continous deployment

Jenkins terminology:
--------------------
Jenkins works as a Master and Slave architecture.

Jenkins Master:
---------------

Jenkins master handles below tasks
    Schedule build jobs
    Dispatch builds to slaves for actual job execution
    Monitor the slaves and record the build results and presenting the build reports
    Can also executes build jobs directly

Jenkins Slave:
--------------

Jenkins slave is a small java program it listens the requests from  jenkins master. 
It will execute build jobs dispatched by master
    
It is possible to configure a job always to run on particular slave  machine

Slaves are computers that are setup to build projects for master
Jenkins run a seperate rpogram called slave agent on slaves

When slaves are registered to master, a master starts disributing loads to slaves

Plugin:
-------
Plugin is a peice of software that extends the core functionality of jenkins server.
    
In jenkins dashboard there is plugin tab

There are two options

Install plugin w/o restart

downlaod now and install after restart ==> we use this when upgrading plugin

Export java path on linux:
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.191.b12-0.el7_5.x86_64/jre/bin/java
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
readlink -f $(which java) it will give u the path


What does this package do?
Jenkins will be launched as a daemon on startup. See /etc/init.d/jenkins for more details.
The 'jenkins' user is created to run this service. If you change this to a different user via the config file, you must change the owner of /var/log/jenkins, /var/lib/jenkins, and /var/cache/jenkins.
Log file will be placed in /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log. Check this file if you are troubleshooting Jenkins.
/etc/sysconfig/jenkins will capture configuration parameters for the launch.
By default, Jenkins listen on port 8080. Access this port with your browser to start configuration.  Note that the built-in firewall may have to be opened to access this port from other computers.  (See http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/disable-linux-firewall-under-centos-rhel-fedora/ for instructions how to disable the firewall permanently)
A Jenkins RPM repository is added in /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo
